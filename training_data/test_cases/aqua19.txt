The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) in Eastern Visayas has prohibited the gathering and selling of shellfish due to the presence of red tide toxins in the Cancabato Bay here.

Dr. Nancy Dayap, manager of the BFAR-8 regional fisheries laboratory, said the toxicity level in the bay reached 200 microgram saxitoxin per 100 grams of shellfish meat, or higher than the regulatory limit of 60.

“Beyond that regulatory level, we must declare a ban,” Dayap said in a phone interview on Tuesday.

However, shrimps, fish, and crabs from Cancabato Bay are safe to eat as long as they are fresh and washed thoroughly, and internal organs like gills and intestines are removed before cooking.

Earlier, the BFAR in the region has declared the presence of red tide toxin in the bays of Irong-Irong, Silanga, and San Pedro, all in Samar; and Matarinao Bay in Eastern Samar.
