The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) has lifted the shellfish ban in eight towns in Bataan.

BFAR implemented the shellfish ban in November due to high level of toxicity recorded in coastal waters of the province.

Through shellfish bulletin no. 06, BFAR declared eight municipalities: Balanga, Orani, Mariveles, Limay, Samal, Abucay, Pilar and Orion free from shellfish poison.


Now that the ban has been lifted, BFAR said shellfish such as tahong or mussels, lukan, talaba, and bahong, among others, are now safe for human consumption provided that they are fresh and cleaned thoroughly before cooking.
