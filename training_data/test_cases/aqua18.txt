Fish from Taal Lake are safe for consumption as long as these were caught alive, cleaned and cooked properly, the Department of Agriculture-Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (DA-BFAR) declared.

“DA-BFAR conducted laboratory analyses for water and fish samples in Taal Lake and revealed that consumption of fish from Taal Lake is safe, but it must be confined to those that are fresh and caught alive. Caught fish must be washed thoroughly, internal organs removed, and cooked properly,” the DA said in a bulletin issued Sunday.

The assurance was made after the Department of Health warned the public against buying and eating fish from Taal Lake as this may impose health risks such as stomach pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.

As of Tuesday, the National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council (NDRRMC) said total damage and losses in the provinces of Batangas, Laguna and Cavite as a result of Taal Volcano’s eruption has reached to P3.2 billion


The DA earlier said it is ready to provide tilapia, catfish, carp, ayungin and shrimp  fingerlings  “once aquaculture operation resumes and suitable areas are identified.”

Meanwhile, Taal Lake Aquaculture Alliance, Inc. (TLLAI),  which is composed of almost 6,000 fish cage owners in Taal Lake appealed to authorities to allow them to harvest the huge volume of fish still inside their floating cages.

“The fish farmers living along the coast of Taal Lake were severely affected by the volcano’s impending eruption. In the blink of an eye, we lost almost everything we worked hard for. Based on official figures from the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, about 6,000 fish cages with 15,000 metric tons of fish are threatened by Taal’s eruption,” the group said in a statement.

“Aside from being our main source of livelihood, the fish feeds our families and is a rich source of protein for thousands of Filipinos. We harvest an estimated 300 metric tons of fish from our fish cages in Taal lake everyday,” they added.

This, amid the Department of the Interior and Local Government’s order to implement a total lockdown within the danger zone of Taal Volcano.
