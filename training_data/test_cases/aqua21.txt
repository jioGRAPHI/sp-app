The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources on Tuesday warned Bataan residents against consuming shellfish like tahong (mussels) and alamang (acetes shrimp) after red tide toxins were detected in the waters in eight coastal towns and one city in Bataan province.

Wilfredo Cruz, BFAR Central Luzon director, said affected are Orani, Hermosa, Mariveles, Limay, Orion, Pilar, Samal, Abucay, and Balanga City.

Cruz said the gathering and transporting of shellfish in the said areas are prohibited.

He said BFAR was continuously monitoring paralytic shellfish poisons.
