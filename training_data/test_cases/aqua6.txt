Authorities are investigating the cause of the fish kill here Wednesday afternoon.

The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources already gathered samples from the Roseller Lim Boulevard, where the dead fish had washed up, while a cleanup by the Office of the City Environment and Natural Resources continues to prevent residents from collecting the fish for health reasons.

Sources said the kind of fish that were found along Zamboanga’s shoreline were deep water fish. City Agriculturist Carmencita Sanchez said the fish kill may have been caused by depleted oxygen in the water caused by extreme heat. 


The probe will also determine other possible causes of the fish kill.

Zamboanga City has been experiencing a dry spell. A climate advisory issued by the state weather bureau last week stated that El Niño will wane by the end of May.

Meanwhile, the local government also banned swimming and fishing at the boulevard, a famous land mark in Zamboanga City.
