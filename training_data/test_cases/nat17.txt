The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) on Friday urged garbage collectors to disinfect waste to stem the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Garbage collectors must disinfect collected waste before they are sent to trash sites, Environment Secretary Roy Cimatu said.

Garbage trucks must also be sanitized before it can start its next round of waste collection, he added.


He also stressed that medical waste, including masks and gloves used by health workers against infectious diseases, needs proper disposal.

The agency will coordinate with local government units on how to properly dispose waste.

As more than 50 million people in Luzon are placed under lockdown, Cimatu said households should segregate and sanitize their trash bags before they are collected.

Households can make their own cleaning solution by mixing 10 to 15 percent of bleach with clean water, he said.
