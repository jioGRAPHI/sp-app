Agriculture Secretary William Dar on Monday urged sellers of ornamental plants to lower prices, as his agency deferred regulating these.
During this pandemic, sellers of ornamental plants should not take advantage because many Filipinos want to have plants in their home.
But we don't plan to regulate so I hope sellers can help us lower the price because the plants are just there, they are not imported. And even if they are imported, the price should not be too high.
