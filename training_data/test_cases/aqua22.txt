The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) here announced the start of the three-month fishing ban on “galunggong” (round scad) in the northeastern towns of Palawan on November 1.

Now on its fifth year of implementation, the closed fishing season for galunggong until January 31 next year aims to protect the galunggong species during its peak spawning season citing the observed increase in maturity size and catch trend, said Myrna B. Candelario, acting center chief of BFAR Inland Sea Ranching Station.


“From 2016 to 2019, we have been receiving a positive trend, which indicates that the program is effective. That’s why we continue with the annual implementation in (the towns of) Cuyo, Roxas, Araceli, at Dumaran,” she said.

Some 1,302 fisherfolk who would be affected by the ban, would each be given P15,000 financial assistance.
