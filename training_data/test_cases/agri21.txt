Agriculture Secretary William Dar on Tuesday (Dec. 8) announced that P768 million will be allocated in 2021 to help farmers and boost agricultural growth in Negros Occidental.
Dar, who was in Negros Occidental to turn over P453,147,588 in projects and aid to farmers and fishermen, said the Department of Agriculture’s (DA) projects were designed to help farmers become more competitive.
He said farm machinery would be given every year to farmers’ groups in Negros Occidental.
The DA’s goal, he said, is to lower farmers’ production cost and raise their productivity.
Dar said agriculture was the only sector that registered positive growth in the country during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“The aim is to ensure the country’s food security. In due time we will be able to produce 100 percent if not near 100 percent of our food requirements,” he said.
He said the country cannot fight COVID-19 if it did not have enough food for its people.
Negros Occidental Gov. Eugenio Jose Lacson said the DA projects would boost production and increase income of farmers aside from easing the impact of the pandemic on the province’s agricultural sector.
