The regional office of the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) in Bicol will be constructed soon in Sta. Cruz village, beside the Philippine National Police provincial office and the Land Transportation District Office.

The city government donated the lot, around 2,500 square meters, for it.

The deed of donation was executed between Representative Fernando Cabredo, Mayor Patricia Gonzalez- Alsua, BFAR director Nelson Bien with city environment natural resource officer Sol Preña, and Sangguniang Bayan members.

“The advantages of having the BFAR regional office (are it) will strengthen the fight against illegal fishing and promotion of marine and aquatic resources, particularly a hatchery will be set up at Albay west coast area,” Cabredo said.

Aside from the BFAR office, other national agencies Bureau of Fire and Protection, Philippine Statistics Authority Regional offices will also be erected and will be operational in the coming years in the city.
