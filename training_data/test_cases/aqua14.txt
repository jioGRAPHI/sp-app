The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) in Central Luzon on Monday cautioned the public against gathering, selling, and eating “tahong” (mussel) in Bataan following reports of red tide toxin in the province’s fishing ground.

BFAR personnel said the waters in the municipalities of Mariveles, Limay, Orion, Pilar, Hermosa, Orani, Abucay, and Samal, and the City of Balanga were found positive for red tide toxin in recent monitoring.

Ma. Theresa Escolano, director of the office of civil defense in Central Luzon, said shellfish found in these areas were not safe to eat.

“Fish, squids, shrimps, and crabs are safe for human consumption as long as these are fresh and washed thoroughly,” said Escolano.

Engr. Joey Dizon, head of the provincial agriculture office, said the sample gathered by the local office of BFAR in the affected areas showed that the toxicity level has reached above the regulatory limit.
