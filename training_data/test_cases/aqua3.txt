The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) on Tuesday said it is looking for alternative sources of tilapia following the damage of Taal Volcano's ashfall to fish cages in Batangas.

"We are expecting for the worst hanggat 'di pa natin matingnan talaga ang damage sa area," BFAR Calabarzon regional director Samuel Malvas told radio DZMM.

The towns of Talisay and Agoncillo were the most affected, he added.

Malvas appealed to vendors not to hike up fish prices following the calamity.

At Kamuning Market in Quezon City, prices of tilapia and tawilis have gone up to P160 per kilo from P130 and P120, respectively.
