Commercial fishing vessels will resume fishing for sardines in the Zamboanga waters by March 1, 2020 yet. December 1 was the start of the closed fishing season.

This, after the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) enforced Administrative Circular 255, “which bans commercial fishing vessels from fishing within the waters of East Sulu Sea, Basilan Strait and Sibugyey Bay”. This is to “give way to the three month spawning period of the sardines”, a BFAR press statement read.

BFAR National Director Eduardo Gongona emphasized the need for the ban, saying “it allows for our sardines fish stocks to replenish, ensuring the abundance and productivity of our marine resources for years to come”.

According to the BFAR, this is the 11th time since 2011 that the closed fishing season has been implemented.

The press statement reads: “Data from the National Stock Assessment Program of BFAR Region IX show continuous increase of sardines in the last four years based on their monitored landed catch: 141,658 metric tons (MT) in 2015; 148,718 MT in 2016; 165,295 MT in 2017; and 188,839 MT in 2018. Sardinella lemuru (tamban-tuloy) tops among other sardine species with 183,884MT in 2018.”
